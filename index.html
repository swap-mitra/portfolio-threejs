        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Swapnil, a 21-year old Front-End Developer. I am currently
          pursuing my B.Tech in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering from
          Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know what you are thinking right now it's a pretty weird combination
          of streams, but that's what makes me unique. I found my interest in
          designing and coding only in the 1st year of college.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2019, I have been learning, from the resources which are
          available on the internet for free. I have taught myself designing,
          coding and modelling at the same time studying in college & also
          taking time out to watch anime.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am skilled in HTML, CSS, React.js, React Native, Next.js, Figma,
          Three.js, Photoshop and Blender. I am fluent with Redux, StripeAPI,
          Firebase, Node.js, Express, MongoDB. I am also familiar with User
          Experience Design (UED), Digital Marketing, Product Development,
          Product Management and Agile Methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from the above, I love the idea of creating passive income &
          side hustle. I always try to find new opportunities to learn more as I
          grow. I am also a self proclaimed biblio and cinephile.
        </p>
